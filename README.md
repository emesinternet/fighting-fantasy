# Fighting Fantasy Companion

A minimal HTML and JavaScript adventure sheet for Fighting Fantasy books. Track player Skill, Stamina, and Luck, inventory notes, meals, and potions, manage monster encounters, and resolve combat and luck tests in the browser.

New games now start with a single dialog that lets you re-roll each stat before locking them in, followed by a potion picker that explains each option. Starting Skill, Stamina, and Luck stay pinned beside the title (only a Potion of Fortune can raise Luck), while potion status and usage controls live next to Meals for quick reference.
