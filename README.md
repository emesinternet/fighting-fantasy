# Fighting Fantasy Companion

A minimal HTML and JavaScript adventure sheet for Fighting Fantasy books. Track player Skill, Stamina, and Luck, inventory notes, meals, and potions, manage monster encounters, and resolve combat and luck tests in the browser.

New games now start with a single dialog that lets you re-roll each stat before locking them in, followed by a potion picker that explains each option. Starting Skill, Stamina, and Luck are pinned beside their inputs (only a Potion of Fortune can raise Luck), while potion status and usage controls live next to Meals and disable once the potion is spent. Monster boxes start at three, can be added or removed freely (defeated enemies disappear automatically), and a Luck modal offers clear choices for general tests or combat damage adjustments.
